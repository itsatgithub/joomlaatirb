In order to implement the automatic block of users when they fail 3 or more login attempts
the file application.php of the Joomla core has been modified. So when installing 
the com_science component it is needed to manually install the modified file by executing the command:

$ cp components/com_science/helpers/html/application.php.tobeinstalled \
libraries/joomla/application/application.php
